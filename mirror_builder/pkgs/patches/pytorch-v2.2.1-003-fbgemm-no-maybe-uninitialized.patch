With recent gcc, fbgemm doesn't build with -Wmaybe-uninitialized and upstream
recommends building with -Wno-error=maybe-uninitialized

https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/issues/1666
https://pytorch.org/FBGEMM/fbgemm-development/BuildInstructions.html

PyTorch itself uses -Wno-maybe-uninitialized but this doesn't get passed
through to fbgemm.
